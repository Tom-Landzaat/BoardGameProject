# BoardGameProject
Completed as a class project focused on mastering classes. User determined board size and option to see all entities or play with hint cues only. Players can win by shooting the monster with an arrow or collecting the gold and returning to the start. Beware, bats will reverse all input for five turns while stalactites have a chance to fall and end your game. Entering the room with the monster is instant game over...
